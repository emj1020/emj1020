- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Liz Johnson & welcome to my github page. I am a mathematician, physicist, and urban data scientist actively searching for job opportunities in mainly local government & public sector, consulting, NGOs, and think tanks.

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m passionate about social & racial equity. I look to pursue these interests through science communication, data analysis and visualization.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently in my masters degree at NYU's Center for Urban Science & Progress where I am learning how to apply machine learning techniques, mainly using NYC open source data, to quantify & solve societal issues that impact urban communities. I am extremely interested in the topics of educational equity, criminal justice, affordable housing & residential segregation, and data & innovation in the public sector.
