👋 Hi, I’m Liz & welcome to my GitHub! I am a data scientist committed to advancing criminal justice reform and social impact through data-driven insights. Currently, I work with [The Clean Slate Initiative (CSI)](https://www.cleanslateinitiative.org/), where I focus on breaking down barriers for individuals with criminal records, ensuring they can fully participate in their communities, access meaningful employment, and achieve their potential. Our work empowers people to overcome their past and build a better future, contributing to a more just society.

Previously, I was at the Data Collaborative for Justice, where I created and launched the [NYC Jail Population Tracker](https://nyc-jail-population-tracker.datacollaborativeforjustice.org/)—a first-of-its-kind, real-time dashboard designed to track New York City’s jail population and monitor progress toward closing Rikers Island by 2027. This tool provides policymakers, advocates, journalists, and the public with essential insights into the city's criminal justice system, underscoring the power of data to inform decisions and drive meaningful reform.

👩🏻‍🎓 I received my master's degree from NYU's Center for Urban Science & Progress, where I learned to apply machine learning techniques, mainly using open-source data, to quantify and solve societal issues that impact urban communities. I also have a Bachelor's Degree in Mathematics and Physics from Bates College. 

🏡 I am originally from Boston, MA, but currently reside in Brooklyn, NY. 

💃🏻 In my free time, I enjoy cycling, yoga, exploring new restaurants and museums, reading sci-fi and fantasy books, listening to true crime podcasts, and hanging out with my dog!
