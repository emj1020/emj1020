- 👋 Hi, I’m Liz & welcome to my GitHub! I am a mathematician, physicist, and urban data scientist.

- 👩🏻‍🎓 I have my master's degree from NYU's Center for Urban Science & Progress where I learned to apply machine learning techniques, mainly using open source data, to quantify & solve societal issues that impact urban communities. I am extremely interested in the topics of criminal justice, equity, affordable housing & residential segregation, and data & innovation in the public sector. I look forward to sharing the projects I complete with the public on my github account. 

- 🏡 I am originally from Boston, MA but currently reside in Brooklyn, NY. 

- 💃🏻 In my free time I enjoy cycling, yoga, exploring new restaurants and museums, reading non-fiction, listening to true crime podcasts, and hanging out with my dog!
